# JavaScript Problem Solving Task

This repository contains solutions to 10 basic JavaScript problem-solving tasks.  
All solutions are written using **plain (vanilla) JavaScript**, without using any frameworks or advanced libraries.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my logical thinking, problem-solving ability, and understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. I focused more on writing clear logic and simple code rather than complex or optimized solutions.
